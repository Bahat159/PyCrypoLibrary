# PyCrypt
- **Python Cryptography Library**
  -  A wrapper for the cryptography python library for efficiency and reliablity. An end to end encryption library to send encrypted messages across the internet, also among peer-  to-peer. This library should be revisited in order to make it robust and usable accross all platform.

- **Basic usage**
  - To import a whole wrapper library class module 
     `import Assymetric_Ed25519_signing`
  - To import a single library function. Example below imports generate_private _key to generate a new private key of Assymetric model
       `from Assymetric_Ed25519_signing import generate_ed25519_private_key`
